The cat (Felis catus) is a domesticated species of small carnivorous mammal.  They are the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and are often referred to as domestic cats to distinguish them from members of the wild family. The cat can be either a domestic cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; The latter extends freely and avoids human contact. Humans appreciate domestic cats for their companionship and ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds have been recognized by many cat registries. 
The cat in anatomy is similar to other types of cats: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws that are adapted to killing small prey. Night vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes sounds such as meowing, purring, chanting, hissing, snarling and grunting, as well as a cat's body language. A predatory cat that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), is a solitary hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds that are very faint or very high-frequency to human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones.
